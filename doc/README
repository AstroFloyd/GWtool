The GWtool package provides a few simple tools that may come in handy when working
with gravitational waves.  GWtool is written in Fortran 2003/8 and requires libSUFR
(libsufr.sf.net).

Programs included:
  * gw_coalescence_pmax:          Calculates the maximum initial period that can coalesce within a certain time
  * gw_coalescence_time:          Calculates the time needed to reach a certain Porb (default 0) using gravitational-wave evolution
  * gw_coalescence_time_from_f0:  Calculates time of coalescence for a LIGO binary from certain frequency f0
  * gw_eta2q:                     Compute the symmetric mass ratio &eta; from the asymmetric mass ratio q
  * gw_final_period:              Calculates the orbital period of a detached stellar binary after a given time of GW evolution
  * gw_isco:                      Calculates isco properties for a black hole with given mass and spin
  * gw_ligo_mcmc_injection:       Create an inspiral injection xml to use for lalinference_mcmc
  * gw_ligo_xml2screen:           Print the contents of a LIGO/Virgo injection.xml file to screen
  * gw_m1m2-mceta:                Compute chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio from the individual masses
  * gw_match_wfs:                 Match two time-domain waveforms in specified files
  * gw_mceta-m1m2:                Convert the chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio to individual masses
  * gw_q2eta:                     Compute the symmetric mass ratio &eta; from the asymmetric mass ratio q
