The GWtool package provides a few simple tools that may come in handy when working
with gravitational waves.  GWtool is written in Fortran 2003/8 and requires libSUFR
(libsufr.sf.net).

Programs included:
 * binary_contact_gw:    Compute time of coalescence for given binary masses and period
 * eta2q:                Convert symmetric mass ratio eta to asymmetric mass ratio q
 * isco:		 Compute the ISCO frequency of a black hole with given mass and spin
 * ligo_mcmc_injection:  Create a simple LIGO inspiral injection.xml file
                           for use with lalinference_mcmc
 * ligo_xml2screen:      Print the contents of a LIGO injection.xml file to screen
 * m1m2-mceta:		 Convert binary masses M1,M2 to chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio
 * match_wfs:            Match two time-domain waveforms in files
 * mceta-m1m2:		 Convert binary chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio to M1,M2
 * q2eta:                Convert asymmetric mass ratio q to symmetric mass ratio eta
 * tcoal:		 Compute the coalescence time for a binary with given initial
      			   frequency, masses and spin (for one component)
