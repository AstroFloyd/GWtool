The GWtool package provides a few simple tools that may come in handy when working
with gravitational waves.  GWtool is written in Fortran 2003/8 and requires libSUFR
(libsufr.sourceforge.net).

Programs included:
 * isco:		Compute the ISCO frequency of a black hole with given mass and spin
 * m1m2-mceta		Convert binary masses M1,M2 to chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio
 * mceta-m1m2		Convert binary chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio to M1,M2
 * tcoal		Compute the coalescence time for a binary with given initial 
      			frequency, masses and spin (for one component)
