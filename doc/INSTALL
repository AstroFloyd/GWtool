GWtool INSTALL  -  gwtool.sf.net


You will need CMake to configure and compile GWtool.  CMake is open-source
software, and can be downloaded from cmake.org.


To compile and install the code (in the default directories; /usr/local/...;
the binary executables will be installed in the bin/ subdirectory), from the 
main package directory (the one that contains the file CMakeLists.txt), do:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make
 $ sudo make install


To install GWtool in a specific directory, e.g. /home/me/usr/,
   replace the "cmake .." step above with:

 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/me/usr ..


If you're installing the code somewhere in your home directory, you can leave out
   the sudo command in the last step:

 $ make install


To force CMake to compile GWtool with your favourite compiler, prepend the cmake line
   with e.g. FC=gfortran:

 $ FC=gfortran cmake ..


To compile the code without installing it anywhere, leave out the last step
   ((sudo) make install)
